It's easy to get started using Courier.
You can sign in with your Twitter account at any time for free.

Once you're signed in, you can add your site's feed and Courier will start watching for new posts.
Right away, you'll be able to see the tweets that Courier would post for you.

Courier requires a paid subscription to post tweets to Twitter. You can subscribe from [within the app][account] for **$5 per month**.

You can cancel your subscription at any time, and it will remain active for the remainder of the month.
